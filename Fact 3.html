        Japan is virtually tied with Hong Kong in terms of average life expectancy, at 83.6 years and 84 years. Numerous people attribute Japan’s long life expectancy to the country’s historically healthier diet than Western countries. Their diet includes a greater amount of fish, less red meat and more vegetables, and smaller portions. The Japanese hot springs probably have a lot to do with the long lives in Japan. These hot springs, known as Onsens are frequented by the Japanese for their healing properties.
